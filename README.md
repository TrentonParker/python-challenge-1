## module 2 challenge

**This is my take on the interactive food truck menu! You will be able to select from which food menu to order, select your choice of food from that menu, select a quantity, and decide whether or not to keep ordering more! Once done ordering, a receipt will be printed with the overview of your order, including the quantities of each item followed by the total cost of it all. ðŸ˜€**

*This took me a lot of trial and error, but in the end I think it turned out alright. I'm excited to keep learning more!*
